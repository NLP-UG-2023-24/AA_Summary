### 4.2.2. The internal structure of phrases
In this subchapter, sentences are analyzed in terms of four slots where specific types of elements can occur. These slots provide a framework for understanding the organization of phrases within sentences. Slot 1 typically contains articles (like *the* or *a*), demonstratives (like *this* or *that*), or possessives (like *his* or *their*). However, this slot can also remain empty in certain cases. Slot 2 is optionally occupied by an adjective, providing additional description or qualification to the noun in slot 3. Slot 3 is where the central element of the phrase, typically a noun, is placed. Slot 4 can either remain empty or contain larger or smaller constituents, offering flexibility in sentence structure. The concept of the **head of a phrase** is introduced, representing the most important element that determines the phrase's category and meaning. Phrases are named after their heads, providing a convenient way to categorize and analyze sentence structure. Examples of different types of phrases (**noun phrases**, **prepositional phrases**, **adjective phrases**, etc.) are provided, each labeled with its respective head. The text discusses how the head of a phrase is determined, considering factors such as **semantic importance**, **structural relations**, and **distributional properties**. **Semantic importance** refers to the central role of the head in conveying the core meaning or function of the phrase. **Structural relations** involve the assignment of case or the syntactic function of the constituents within the phrase. **Distributional properties** refer to the positions in the sentence where the head or its phrase can occur. The authors continue to explore the criteria for classifying words into different word classes (nouns, verbs, adjectives, prepositions, etc.). Semantic, morphological, and syntactic criteria are considered for determining word class membership, and examples are provided to illustrate how these criteria can be applied to classify words, even in cases where the meaning of the word is unknown. Moreover, determiners, demonstratives, and possessives are discussed, highlighting their syntactic distribution and their role as pro-forms within phrases. Finally, the authors introduce phrase structure rules as a formal way to generate grammatical sentences with example rules provided, demonstrating how sentences can be constructed from noun phrases, verb phrases, and prepositional phrases according to syntactic principles.
## 4.3. The functional level: subjects, objects, adverbials, predicates
The chapter begins by referencing traditional grammar lessons that define sentence functions like subjects, objects, and adverbials. Subjects are typically described as the "doer of the action," objects as the entities affected by the action, and adverbials as constituents providing circumstances of the event. Terminological variations exist, with different grammatical frameworks using terms like **predicate** and **predicator** to refer to different elements within a sentence. The authors acknowledge that traditional definitions need refinement, particularly when considering constructions like the passive voice, where subjects don't necessarily represent the 'doer' of the action. Additionally, the authors introduce the idea of structural criteria, such as subject-verb agreement and sentential position. The text mentions that subjects trigger subject-verb agreement and occupy a fixed position before the verb phrase in English sentences. Subjects are obligatory in English sentences, unlike in some other languages, and exhibit morphological distinctions in pronouns. Objects receive object case morphology and appear immediately after the verb in English sentences. Objects are also obligatorily present in sentences with transitive verbs, but exceptions exist where [transitive verbs](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/transitive-verbs/) can have covert objects. Lastly, objects can be passivized, indicating their object status. In the case of adverbials, they provide circumstantial information about the action denoted by the verb. They are non-obligatory constituents and can be omitted without causing ungrammaticality. In essence, adverbials may not always contain adverbs but can be realized by phrases like prepositional phrases (PPs) or noun phrases (NPs). The authors proceed to state that complements serve as functional elements at both the sentence and phrase levels. As for objects at the sentence level, they correspond to complements at the phrase level. Finally, when it comes to predicative complements, they are introduced for verbs like "be," which provide information about the subject rather than representing affected entities.
## 4.4. The mapping of form and function
The chapter begins with discussing adverbials, which provide circumstantial information about the action denoted by the verb and can be realized by various forms. They can be represented by [noun phrases (NP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_phrase), [prepositional phrases (PP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adpositional_phrase#Prepositional_phrases), and [adverbial phrases (ADVP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverbial_phrase), as well as [verb phrases (VP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb_phrase) and [clauses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clause). Examples include: 
* NP: [last year]
* PP: [in the nearby mountains]
* ADVP: [so late]
* VP: [hoping for a successful career]
* Clause: [because she had hoped to make a successful career]

According to the authors, while subjects and objects are typically realized by noun phrases (NPs), other forms can also fulfill these grammatical functions. Subordinate clauses, verb phrases (VP), and prepositional phrases (PP) can act as subjects or objects. Examples include:
* Subordinate Clause as Subject: [That you are lying] is obvious.
* Subordinate Clause as Object: I know [that you are lying].
* VP as Subject: [Hoping for a career at university] was futile.
* VP as Object: He hated [going to his linguistics classes].
* PP as Object: She gave the book [to the librarian].

The passage presents a mapping table that illustrates the complex relationship between the form and function of constituents in English sentences. It demonstrates that a given form can realize different functions, and a given function can be realized by a variety of forms.
## 4.5. Conclusion
In Chapter 4.5, the authors summarize the key points discussed regarding the investigation of sentence structure. The chapter explores various methods for investigating the structure of sentences. Syntactic constituency can be examined through systematic observations of structural and morphological patterns within word strings. By analyzing evidence obtained through pronominalization, coordination, gapping, movement, passivization, omission, and morphological operations, grammatical categories such as word classes and phrases can be established. These categories help in understanding the arrangement of words in English sentences. The chapter delves into the functions of subjects, objects, and adverbials. Detailed discussions are provided on how these functions are mapped onto the formal categories established earlier in the chapter. Various criteria are outlined for distinguishing between sentence functions and describing their behaviors. These criteria include structural, morphological, and syntactic features that help differentiate subjects, objects, and adverbials. It is emphasized that each sentential function can be realized by multiple formal categories. Similarly, a single formal category may serve different functions within a sentence.

# Chapter 7: Extensions and applications: historical linguistics, sociolinguistics, and psycholinguistics 
This chapter delves into the extensions and applications of linguistics, focusing on historical linguistics, sociolinguistics, and psycholinguistics. It aims to answer questions regarding language change and interrelations among languages, sociological influences on language, and the ability of humans to store and process language in relation to our cognitive capacities.

## Historical linguistics
At the end of the 18th century, **William Jones** made a groundbreaking discovery during his study of Sanskrit – an ancient Indian language. Jones proposed that since Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin, together with Celtic and Old Persian, share common features, it seems that they also share ancestry. His discovery led to an advancement in the field of historical linguistics.

To understand the concept of shared linguistic features across languages, one could examine English and German ¬– languages exhibiting many systematic correspondences that cannot be accidental. Not only much of their vocabulary is similar in meaning, but also phonological correspondences can be observed. While some sounds, such as /b/, /f/, and /n/ remain the same, others have undergone systematic changes. For instance, English /p/, /t/, /k/ systematically developed into German /pf/ or /f/, /t/ or /ts/, and /x/, respectively. It is highly unlikely that these correspondences are due to chance. There are two possibilities to explain such systematic correspondences – linguistic borrowing or shared ancestral language. 

In this case, however, it seems that English and German stem from the common ancestor. Moreover, languages such as Dutch and Frisian appear also related since, like English, they exhibit the voiceless plosive /p/, while German shows affricates /pf/ or fricatives /f/. Thus, they seem to develop from the same ancestral language, but either German or the three languages must have undergone a sound change at some point in their history. It appears to be German since it is more likely that only one language was subject to this change, and the shift from [plosives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plosive) to [fricatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fricative) or [affricates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affricate) is very common across languages and motivated by articulatory reasons.

**Comparative reconstruction**, a methodological approach which entails the systematic comparison of related languages, is applied to establish genetic relations between languages. In this case, it was established that the sound /p/ was a part of the phonetic inventory of the ancestor of English, Frisian, Dutch, German (and many more) – **Proto-Germanic**. In turn, Proto-Germanic belongs to the family of **Indo-European languages**, which consists of the following main branches: 

* Tocharian 
* Anatolian
* Hellenic
* Italic
* Balto-Slavic
* Albanian
* Indo-Iranian
* Armenian 
* Germanic
* Celtic

The above-mentioned change of voiceless plosives into affricates and fricatives in German is known as the **Second Germanic Sound Shift**; it began between the 3rd and 5th and ended in the 9th century. While both English and German belong to the West Germanic languages, German is classified as Inland Germanic, whereas English as North Sea Germanic. This divergence is the reason behind the discrepancies between velar sounds found in English _book_ and German _Buch_. The change affected only the group of the Inland Germanic, thus, excluding English. Nonetheless, there are still words in German that contain voiceless plosives.  This phenomenon could occur due to the fact that the sound change did not affect all voiceless plosive in every possible environment, or they were borrowed from other languages after the shift was completed.

Prior to the Second Consonant Shift, around 1000 BC, the **First Consonant Shift**, commonly referred to as **Grimm’s Law**, occurred. This change in Proto-Germanic consonants distinguished the Germanic branch from all other languages of Proto-Indo-European. The shift could be simplified in the following way – Proto-Germanic aspirated voiceless plosives, voiced plosives, and voiceless plosives evolved into voiced plosives, voiceless plosives, and voiceless fricative, respectively. 

Reconstructing individual languages is yet another aim of historical linguistics. The task is challenging since there are no native speaker of languages such as Prot-Indo-European or Proto-Germanic. Historical linguists attempt to gather as much data as possible, including manuscripts, runic inscriptions, stone crosses, or gravestones to name but a few. By examining such attestations, it is possible to reconstruct the evolution of languages.

The origins of English trace back to 449 AD, when Saxons, Angles, and Jutes (speakers of different Germanic dialects) invaded Britain. The combination of their languages eventually gave rise to English, which underwent many changes in the course of history. For example, orthographically, Old English letters such as <ð>, <Þ>, and macrons vanished. Pronunciation changes, like /d/ becoming /ð/ in words like fæder, and lexical shifts occurred; words like _Þēod_ and _cwæð_ fell out of use or changed meaning. English was influenced significantly by languages such as Celtic, Scandinavian, French, and Latin. The history of English is usually divided into four periods: Old English, Middle English, Early Modern English, and Modern English. 

## Sociolinguistics: the social significance of language
Sociolinguistics focuses on the link between language and society, examining how linguistic features differ among different groups. This could be illustrated with the variability in pronouncing the verbal suffix "-ing". This suffix has two variants – [ɪŋ] and [ɪn]; importantly, its usage is not influenced by linguistics rules but rather by social factors. **Variability**, which is similar to allomorphy in morphology, provokes questions regarding why speakers choose particular variants. It is suggested that [ɪŋ] is considered as standard and [ɪn] as colloquial, a difference indicating social prestige. Sociolinguistic variables such as "(ing)" demonstrate such variation, highlighting the importance of social context in language use.

People tend to portray non-standard varieties of a language, including regional dialects, as incorrect or sloppy. Nevertheless, it is definitely not the case from a scientific perspective. Native speakers of regional dialects are not incorrect speakers of Standard English, but they are proficient in their variety of language. Standard and non-standard English, similarly to English and German, as varieties of languages, differ from each other, presenting distinct linguistic systems. Since neither English nor German is perceived as an incorrect way of speaking, it only seems reasonable to treat non-standard forms as correct. While dialects have their own linguistic rules and vocabulary, they lack the societal prestige of the standard form, which holds sway in formal settings. Thus, using a dialect in such contexts isn't grammatically erroneous but socially inappropriate.

Delving deeper into the usage of suffix -ing, a study by **Trudgill's (1974)** in Norwich examined the distribution of its variants – [ɪŋ] and [ɪn], demonstrating their correlation with social factors. Trudgill cclassified speakers into five different social classes on the basis of income, occupation, and education. He also identified four speaking styles, ranging from formal to casual. Results demonstrated that formal styles favored [ɪŋ], while informal styles [ɪn]. Moreover, speakers from higher classes tended to use [ɪŋ], while those from lower classes more frequently used [ɪn]. The evidence supports the hypothesis that [ɪŋ] is considered more formal and socially prestigious, while [ɪn] is regarded non-standard and typical of lower social strata.

Examining standard and non-standard variants of languages often reveals language as a marker of identity and social class, similarly to clothing. Speech patterns express individuals' social and geographical affiliations. Social identity manifests across linguistic levels, including lexicon, phonology, morphology, and syntax. Variations exist in word choice (e.g., _prof_ vs. _professor_) and syntactic structures (e.g., _She don’t want no coffee_ vs. _She doesn’t want any coffee_), which illustrate the nuanced role of language in reflecting societal positioning.

The divergence in language usage among people from different social classes can be attributed to restricted communication channels within social class systems. **Bogart's (1950–1)** study in a rural American town demonstrated how news spread unevenly across social classes where age, sex, and neighbourhood turned out irrelevant factors. Lower social classes were less aware of a particular event than higher classes, which indicates limited interaction between classes. The lack of cross-class contact allows distinct speech patterns to emerge within each class, eventually becoming markers of social identity.

**Labov's (1972)** study of Martha's Vineyard residents highlighted language as a marker of social identity. Islanders exhibited a distinct pronunciation of certain diphthongs, centralizing them compared to standard English. However, variation existed among islanders in their usage of these local variants, influenced by their attitudes towards the island and its lifestyle. Positive attitudes correlated with greater centralization, as islanders sought to emphasize their identity as native Vineyarders, distinguishing themselves from tourists who adhered to standard pronunciation. This demonstrates how language variation reflects social allegiance and identity.

The examples illustrate how language serves as a badge of identity, not only in pronunciation but also in word choice and syntactic constructions. People select linguistic variants that not only convey the intended message but also express non-linguistic concepts like attitude, group identity, or formality level. This demonstrates the multifaceted role of language in reflecting and shaping social identity and interaction.
