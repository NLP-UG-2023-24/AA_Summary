### 4.2.2. The internal structure of phrases
In the subchapter, sentences are analyzed in terms of four slots where specific types of elements can occur. These slots provide a framework for understanding the organization of phrases within sentences. Slot 1 typically contains articles (like "the" or "a"), demonstratives (like "this" or "that"), or possessives (like "his" or "their"). However, this slot can also remain empty in certain cases. Slot 2 is optionally occupied by an adjective, providing additional description or qualification to the noun in slot 3. Slot 3 is where the central element of the phrase, typically a noun, is placed. Slot 4 can either remain empty or contain larger or smaller constituents, offering flexibility in sentence structure. The concept of the head of a phrase is introduced, representing the most important element that determines the phrase's category and meaning. Phrases are named after their heads, providing a convenient way to categorize and analyze sentence structure. Examples of different types of phrases (noun phrases, prepositional phrases, adjective phrases, etc.) are provided, each labeled with its respective head. The text discusses how the head of a phrase is determined, considering factors such as semantic importance, structural relations, and distributional properties. Semantic importance refers to the central role of the head in conveying the core meaning or function of the phrase. Structural relations involve the assignment of case or the syntactic function of the constituents within the phrase. Distributional properties refer to the positions in the sentence where the head or its phrase can occur. The authors continue to explore the criteria for classifying words into different word classes (nouns, verbs, adjectives, prepositions, etc.). Semantic, morphological, and syntactic criteria are considered for determining word class membership, and examples are provided to illustrate how these criteria can be applied to classify words, even in cases where the meaning of the word is unknown. Moreover, determiners, demonstratives, and possessives are discussed, highlighting their syntactic distribution and their role as pro-forms within phrases. Finally, the authors introduce phrase structure rules as a formal way to generate grammatical sentences with example rules provided, demonstrating how sentences can be constructed from noun phrases, verb phrases, and prepositional phrases according to syntactic principles.
## 4.3. The functional level: subjects, objects, adverbials, predicates
The chapter begins by referencing traditional grammar lessons that define sentence functions like subjects, objects, and adverbials. Subjects are typically described as the "doer of the action," objects as the entities affected by the action, and adverbials as constituents providing circumstances of the event. Terminological variations exist, with different grammatical frameworks using terms like "predicate" and "predicator" to refer to different elements within a sentence. The authors acknowledge that traditional definitions need refinement, particularly when considering constructions like the passive voice, where subjects don't necessarily represent the 'doer' of the action. Additionally, the authors introduce the idea of structural criteria, such as subject-verb agreement and sentential position. The text mentions that subjects trigger subject-verb agreement and occupy a fixed position before the verb phrase in English sentences. Subjects are obligatory in English sentences, unlike in some other languages, and exhibit morphological distinctions in pronouns. Objects receive object case morphology and appear immediately after the verb in English sentences. Objects are also obligatorily present in sentences with transitive verbs, but exceptions exist where transitive verbs can have covert objects. Lastly, objects can be passivized, indicating their object status. In the case of adverbials, they provide circumstantial information about the action denoted by the verb. They are non-obligatory constituents and can be omitted without causing ungrammaticality. In essence, adverbials may not always contain adverbs but can be realized by phrases like prepositional phrases (PPs) or noun phrases (NPs). The authors proceed to state that complements serve as functional elements at both the sentence and phrase levels. As for objects at the sentence level, they correspond to complements at the phrase level. Finally, when it comes to predicative complements, they are introduced for verbs like "be," which provide information about the subject rather than representing affected entities.
## 4.4. The mapping of form and function
The chapter begins with discussing adverbials, which provide circumstantial information about the action denoted by the verb and can be realized by various forms. They can be represented by noun phrases (NP), prepositional phrases (PP), and adverbial phrases (ADVP), as well as verb phrases (VP) and clauses. Examples include: 
* NP: [last year]
* PP: [in the nearby mountains]
* ADVP: [so late]
* VP: [hoping for a successful career]
* Clause: [because she had hoped to make a successful career]

According to the authors, while subjects and objects are typically realized by noun phrases (NPs), other forms can also fulfill these grammatical functions. Subordinate clauses, verb phrases (VP), and prepositional phrases (PP) can act as subjects or objects. Examples include:
* Subordinate Clause as Subject: [That you are lying] is obvious.
* Subordinate Clause as Object: I know [that you are lying].
* VP as Subject: [Hoping for a career at university] was futile.
* VP as Object: He hated [going to his linguistics classes].
* PP as Object: She gave the book [to the librarian].

The passage presents a mapping table that illustrates the complex relationship between the form and function of constituents in English sentences. It demonstrates that a given form can realize different functions, and a given function can be realized by a variety of forms.
## 4.5. Conclusion
In Chapter 4.5, the authors summarize the key points discussed regarding the investigation of sentence structure. The chapter explores various methods for investigating the structure of sentences. Syntactic constituency can be examined through systematic observations of structural and morphological patterns within word strings. By analyzing evidence obtained through pronominalization, coordination, gapping, movement, passivization, omission, and morphological operations, grammatical categories such as word classes and phrases can be established. These categories help in understanding the arrangement of words in English sentences. The chapter delves into the functions of subjects, objects, and adverbials. Detailed discussions are provided on how these functions are mapped onto the formal categories established earlier in the chapter. Various criteria are outlined for distinguishing between sentence functions and describing their behaviors. These criteria include structural, morphological, and syntactic features that help differentiate subjects, objects, and adverbials. It is emphasized that each sentential function can be realized by multiple formal categories. Similarly, a single formal category may serve different functions within a sentence.
