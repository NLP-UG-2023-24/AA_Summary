# Chapter 4 The structure of sentences: syntax

## 4.1. Introduction: rules and grammar

This chapter starts with an explanation of how people form sentences out of specifically chosen words in sequences based on the syntax rules such as the word order. The author presents 2 sets of grammatical and ungrammatical sentences to illustrate the point. Sentences that lack the subject, their word order is not subject verb object or that miss the main verb are judged ungrammatical. However, some of the sentences could still be decoded by English as L1 or L2 speakers depending on the type of the mistake. 
The author then proceeds to provide the definition of syntax as structure of sentences. The concept of grammar is said to be ambiguous as its scientific meaning (system of phonological, morphological, syntactic and semantic information and rules that speaker of a given language possess) is different from the everyday usage of the term. 
The latter meaning refers to a book of grammar rules described to various extents. Grammar books are considered inadequate by the author, especially the ones written for less advanced learners. In conclusion, the authors of such books are not able to fully picture and properly describe such a complex language system.

# 4.2 The building blocks: words and phrases
## 4.2.1 Constituency tests and phrases 

An analysis of a following sentence is described:
‘(4) Many people will go to the station every morning.’. The sentence is divided into constituents such as [Many people], [go to the station], [every morning]. A tree diagram for the sentence is provided below.


 

Such diagram does not say anything about the internal structure of the phrases. As a matter of fact, the author provides 3 solutions on how to check whether [will go] can be regarded a constituent. 
The first test called pronominalization is a substitution of a constituent by a pronoun. If this is impossible, the given phrase is not a constituent. Hence, as there is no existing pronoun to substitute [will go]; it is not a constituent.
The second test called movement checks whether in any proper grammatical structure the phrase [will go] changes its word order. For instance, to form a question the auxiliary ‘will’ should be fronted thus, the phrase is split by the subject. 

  
In conclusion, another test proved that it is not a constituent. 
The last test presented is the co-ordination test stating that adding conjunction ‘and’ reveals whether the phrase is a constituent. This specific conjunction combines properly only constituents of the same kind. 
 
Sentence (9) reveals [go to the station every morning] and [come home at night] as constituents. 
Moreover, pronominalization is possible as [go to the station every morning] can be replaced by a pronominal phrase ‘do so’. 
Gapping can be observed as well if a question tag  ‘won’t they’ is embedded at the end to form a question proving that large strings can still be easily analyzed.
The author presents a revised tree diagram for a given sentence.
 
The author proceeds to present examples of ambiguous structures such as in sentence (19) My sister will read the letter to John. 
Interpretation number one regards as [the letter to John] as a constituent while number two regards only [the letter] as a constituent. Hence, the sentences can be understood as ‘My sister will read it’ or ‘My sister will read it to John’ depending on whether ‘to John refers to the noun or the verb in the structure. 
                                                                                                                                                                    
# 7.4. Psycholinguistics: how do we store and process language?
 
Psycholinguistics is the study on how humans store and process language in the brain. For instance, categorizing sounds, storing words, producing sentences, segmenting them into meaningful units and acquiring the language. Mental lexicon of a given person can be metaphorically interpreted as a repository of words in one’s mind. Evidence for the existing structures can be observed through study of aphasics and deviant speech. Deviant speech is one that consists of everyday speech errors. 
One of the experiments presented is the ‘lexical decision task’ One sees or hears a word and must decide as quickly as possible whether it is a word of their language. More frequently used word should have shorter reaction times.  This refers to a phenomenon called ‘resting activation’, which is higher more often one retrieves given words. 
The morphological family is also a factor worth considering as simplex words are usually retrieved before complex one from one family. 

# 7.5. Conclusion

Historical linguistics, sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics offer fascinating research questions that can be answered in methodically various ways from reconstructions to experiments. All these branches follow the conventions of phonological, morphological features and many more.
