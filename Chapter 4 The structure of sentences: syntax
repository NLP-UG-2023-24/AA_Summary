Chapter 4 The structure of sentences: syntax

4.1. Introduction: rules and grammar

This chapter starts with an explanation of how people form sentences out of specifically chosen words in sequences based on the syntax rules such as the word order. The author presents 2 sets of grammatical and ungrammatical sentences to illustrate the point. Sentences that lack the subject, their word order is not subject verb object or that miss the main verb are judged ungrammatical. However, some of the sentences could still be decoded by English as L1 or L2 speakers depending on the type of the mistake. 
The author then proceeds to provide the definition of syntax as structure of sentences. The concept of grammar is said to be ambiguous as its scientific meaning (system of phonological, morphological, syntactic and semantic information and rules that speaker of a given language possess) is different from the everyday usage of the term. 
The latter meaning refers to a book of grammar rules described to various extents. Grammar books are considered inadequate by the author, especially the ones written for less advanced learners. In conclusion, the authors of such books are not able to fully picture and properly describe such a complex language system.

4.2 The building blocks: words and phrases
4.2.1 Constituency tests and phrases 

An analysis of a following sentence is described:
‘(4) Many people will go to the station every morning.’. The sentence is divided into constituents such as [Many people], [go to the station], [every morning]. A tree diagram for the sentence is provided below.


 

Such diagram does not say anything about the internal structure of the phrases. As a matter of fact, the author provides 3 solutions on how to check whether [will go] can be regarded a constituent. 
The first test called pronominalisation is a substitution of a constituent by a pronoun. If this is impossible, the given phrase is not a constituent.
