# Introduction: Rules and Grammar

Sentences are formed using syntax rules and specific word orders. Syntax defines sentence structure, while grammar is a system of rules known by speakers. Grammar books often inadequately capture this complexity.

## The Building Blocks: Words and Phrases

Sentences are broken into constituents and analyzed using tree diagrams. Ambiguities in structure can lead to multiple interpretations.

## Internal Structure of Phrases

Sentences have slots for elements like articles, adjectives, and nouns. The "head" of a phrase determines its category and meaning, with different types of phrases analyzed.

## Functional Level: Sentence Elements

Subjects, objects, and adverbials are defined with specific syntactic roles. Subjects agree with verbs, objects follow verbs, and adverbials provide additional information.

## Mapping Form and Function

Adverbials, subjects, and objects can take various forms. A mapping table shows the relationship between form and function, highlighting flexibility in sentence construction.

## Conclusion

The chapter reviews methods for analyzing sentence structure, emphasizing the functions of sentence elements and their mapping to formal categories.

# Extensions: Historical, Sociolinguistics, and Psycholinguistics

## Historical Linguistics

William Jones's discovery of common features in Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin suggests a common ancestry. Comparative reconstruction traces language evolution.

## Sociolinguistics

Language varies among social groups, reflecting social identity and class. Studies show that pronunciation and word choice indicate social affiliations. Non-standard dialects are rule-governed and reflect proficient language use within social contexts.

## Psycholinguistics: Language Processing

Psycholinguistics examines how the brain processes language, stores words, and recognizes frequently used words faster due to "resting activation."
